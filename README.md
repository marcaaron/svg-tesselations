# Browsersync SASS Starter
## Super Simple Front End Development Server

### What does it do?
Runs a concurrent development server that automatically watches your html and compiles your scss files at the same damn time. It's like Code Pen, but local. Props to Wes Bos for the Browsersync settings. They were pulled from his CSS Grid course. Added Node-Sass for auto-watch/compile from scss to css and Concurrently for launching the environment with a single command.

### Why?

Because I got tired of copying and pasting a bunch of code from other package.json files set up the exact same way as this one.

### Usage


1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. `make some cool stuffis`
